# ReactMapDemo

A small react project for generating and displaying GeoJSON data. You can provide properly formatted GeoJSON data in the text field on top and display it on the map below, or on request the application can randomly generate a set of data for you to display. The app also has a navigation form to move the map's view to the selected coordinates.

Supports both features and feature collections, however doesn't automatically generate the latter.
GeoJSON properties are displayed as unformatted strings as popups on the map.
The app currently doesn't support GeometryCollection geometry types.
